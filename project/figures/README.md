folder for all the interesting visualizations we created during the analysis. It is recommended
to store them in PDF or PNG format. Visualizations must have enough data to be easily interpreted
(and reconstructed) later. For visualizations that will be included in the final report, we should also
preserve the program code that created them. If we want, in this folder we can also create subfolders
expl and report in order to separate the visualizations which resulted from the exploratory analysis
and those we have chosen to include in the final report.
