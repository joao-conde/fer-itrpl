This map contains datasets - whether itâ€™s input data, or data that has undergone certain steps
of cleaning and preparation. It is recommended to store data in CSV form, with clearly given names
(if we have more iterations, we use numbers that clearly indicate the process sequence - for example,
01_initial_dataset.csv,02_clean_dataset.csv . . . ).
