# Introduction to R programming language

This course unit was taken at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en), in Zagreb, during an **ERASMUS+ exchange.**

The course unit [*Introduction to R programming language*](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/itrpl) was taught by [Prof. Damir Pintar](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/damir.pintar) and all the workbooks and homeworks as well as their theoretical explanations and questions were provided by him.

My solutions are directly written in these [workbooks](workbooks/) and [homeworks](homeworks/).

```
├── exams             -- RMD (R Markdown) files with executable R chunks for midterm and final exams
